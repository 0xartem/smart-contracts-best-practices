## Specifications and Rollout Plans

- Specs, diagrams, state machines and other documentation that helps understand what the system is intended to do
- Review the specifications to find bugs
- Rollout plans that include details and target dates

## Status

- Where the code is deployed
- Compiler version, flags used, steps to verify the deployed bytecode matches the source code
- Compiler versions and flags that will be used for the different rollout phases
- Current status of deployed code (including outstanding issues, performance stats, etc.)

## Known Issues

- Key risks with contract
- All known bugs/limitations
- Potential attacks and mitigations
- Potential conflicts of interest

## History

- Testing (usage stats, discovered bugs, testing period)
- People/companies who reviews the code and their key feedback

## Procedures

- Action plan in case a bug is discovered (e.g., emergency protocol, public notification process)
- Wind down process if smth goes wrong (e.g., funders will get percentage of your balance before attack, from remaining funds)
- Responsible disclosure policy (e.g., where to report bugs, bug bounty program rules)
- Recource in case of failure (e.g., insurance, penalty fund, no recourse)
